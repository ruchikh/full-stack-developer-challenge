# Full Stack Developer Challenge
This is a programming challenge for a possible full stack developer at Inkredo.

## Requirements
Design a web application that allows authors to publish stories.

### Author view
* Authentication

### Home view
* View all stories with unread (by the author) ones shown first
* Filtering and sorting

### Story view
* Create/delete/update/view drafts
* Publish draft as a story
* Upvote stories
* Drafts are only visible to the author
* Stories are visible to everyone

## Challenge Scope
* Test driven development
* Description of design and technologies used
* Server side API (using a programming language and/or framework of your choice)
  * Full stack web developers at Inkredo currently use Python, React and Node on the server (with PostgreSQL for the database)
* Web app
  * Using a modern web framework (preferably React) that talks to the server side
    * This should integrate with your API, but it's fine to use static responses for some of it 
* Document all assumptions made
* Complete solutions aren't required, but what you do submit needs to run.

## How to complete this challenge
* Fork this repo on GitHub
* Complete the design and code as defined to the best of your abilities
* Complete your work in your own github repo and send the results to us at devs@inkredo.in

## What are we looking for? What does this prove?
* Assumptions you make given limited requirements
* Technology and design choices
* Identify areas of your strengths
* This is not a pass or fail test, this will serve as a common ground that we can deep dive together into specific issues
* Write code as if you are writing code in a team for a production app. Treat it as if you are releasing it to the public.
* Finally, we take pride in the code we write so ensure that your code is well encapsulated and follows a consistent convention.
